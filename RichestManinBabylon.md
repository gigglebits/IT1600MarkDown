# The Richest Man in Babylon
### George S. Clason

The Richest Man in Babylon has been a favorite of Dave Ramsey’s for years. Set in ancient Babylon, this book is an inspiring collection of stories about people who have struggled with—and overcome—the same money problems most Americans face: feeling trapped by debt, living paycheck to paycheck, with little to no savings.

In this exclusive edition of George Clason’s classic, George gives his timeless principles for building lasting wealth, while Dave shares his proven money advice using quotes directly from The Dave Ramsey Show. With powerful storytelling, The Richest Man in Babylon gives fresh perspective and encouragement to all who want to change their lives and win with money.
